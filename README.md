# dp1-sci-prep-seminars
A repository for CST's "DP1 Science Preparation Seminars", based on the DP0 simulated data set.

## Overview

The goal is to increase the number of science community members who know how to use the Rubin Science Platform (RSP) to access the data products they will use for their particular science goals when Data Preview 1 is released.

The approach is to create DP0-based presentations and tutorials that focus on one astronomy sub-field at a time, roughly corresponding to the astronomy sub-fields covered by the LSST Science Collaborations. Many of the existing DP0 tutorials, and past Rubin Science Assemblies, focus on and are advertised by RSP functionality (e.g., learn to use TAP), which are possibly (understandably) less attractive.

Every seminar will include:

 * a brief introduction to the relevant LSST science goals
 * a brief description of the relevant data products (images and catalogs)
 * a hands-on demo of how to query for, retrieve, and visualize the relevant data

In this context, "relevant" means "relevant to the astronomy sub-field of the seminar".

By the end of the seminar, attendees should know how to use the RSP to access LSST data products relevant to their science goals.

## Agenda

These seminars will run in the [Rubin Science Assemblies](https://rubinobservatory.org/for-scientists/resources/workshops-and-seminars) in March, April, and May 2025.

 * Dark Energy
 * Strong Lensing
 * Galaxies
 * Time Domain
 * Active Galactic Nuclei
 * Solar System
 * Stars & Milky Way

See the README pages in the directories for more information about each seminar.
