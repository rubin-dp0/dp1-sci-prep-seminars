## Tutorial

We will demonstrate two notebooks (time permitting):

[DiaObject_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb](https://github.com/lsst/tutorial-notebooks/blob/main/DP0.2/17_DiaObject_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb) (DP0.2 tutorial notebook 17)

* Use an Isolation Forest algorithm on the DP0.2 DiaObject Table to identify anomalies.
* Plot the results and inspect anomalies and lightcurves of anomalous objects.
* Display calexp, difference template, and difference images using Butler.

`VariableStar_Sci_Demo_using_AnomalyDetection.ipynb`

* Use an Isolation Forest algorithm on the DP0.2 DiaObject Table to identify candidate variable stars.
* Plot the results and inspect anomalies.
* Run a Lomb-Scargle algorithm to determine periods, then create phased lightcurves of candidate variable stars.
