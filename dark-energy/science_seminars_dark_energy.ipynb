    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of astronomical surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), \n",
    "a significant objective is to extract cosmological information by scrutinizing subtle deviations in the \n",
    "shapes and orientations of galaxies. \n",
    "These deviations are caused by gravitational lensing from large-scale structures in the foreground. \n",
    "However, the observed shapes of galaxies are not solely influenced by the gravitational lensing effects \n",
    "of the universe's large-scale structure (referred to as \"cosmic shear\"), \n",
    "but also by a combined blurring effect known as the point spread function (PSF). \n",
    "The PSF arises from various factors such as atmospheric conditions (for ground-based instruments), \n",
    "telescope optics, and the image sensor.\n",
    "PSF analysis is thus an integral part of cosmological studies (and is important in other astronomical fields as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 2** introduces and explores the PSF measurements that are available in the `Object` catalogs.\n",
    "One TAP query is executed: one to retrieve a set of `Objects` detected in the `deepCoadd` images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 3** illustrates one chromatic dependence of the PSF: the wavelength dependence of the PSF size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 4** calculates the rho statistics, a series of two-point correlation functions used to diagnose \n",
    "the quality of a PSF model for weak lensing analyses. This calculation is done using the `lsst.analysis.tools` framework.\n"

    "## 3. The wavelength dependence of seeing  \n",
    "\n",
    "To correct for the effects of the Point Spread Function (PSF) and to deduce the weak lensing signal (referred to as \"shear\") from galaxy shapes, the PSF is typically modeled using stars, often bright ones. Subsequently, the PSF of galaxy images is deconvolved by utilizing the estimated PSF convolution kernel. Implicit in this methodology is the assumption that the convolution kernel for galaxies remains the same as that for stars. However, this assumption becomes invalid if the PSF varies with wavelength due to the distinctive Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of stars and galaxies, resulting in disparate PSFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, use the point source sample derived from the `Object` catalog, which was obtained in the preceding sections. Afterward, compute one of the wavelength-dependent components contributing to the PSF owing to atmospheric effects: the wavelength dependence on seeing. As per the standard theory of atmospheric turbulence, the linear dimension `θ` of the atmospheric convolution kernel (i.e., seeing) is inversely proportional to the wavelength, expressed as $\\theta \\propto \\lambda^{-\\frac{1}{5}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional wavelength-dependent contributions to the PSF encompass Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR), telescope diffraction, variations in the absorption length of camera CCDs, and optical chromatic aberrations. In general, each of these factors exhibits distinct functional wavelength dependencies and may exert dominance in different spectral bands. Nevertheless, the wavelength-dependent seeing that we explore in this section tends to be the primary contributor to the PSF. These chromatic PSF effects introduce biases in observables such as photometry, astrometry, measurements of galaxy shape and size, and higher-order moments of the PSF. Addressing these effects is imperative for precise cosmological analysis employing weak gravitational lensing.

    "The expected chromatic dependence of the PSF size should follow a power law of approximately $\\lambda^{-1/5} \\approx \\lambda^{-0.2}$ based on Kolmogorov turbulence. However, the fitted observed exponent is closer to $-0.17$, which is lower than expected. This discrepancy likely arises from two competing effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Finite Outer Scale of Turbulence:** Kolmogorov turbulence assumes an infinite outer scale, but in real-world atmospheric turbulence and simulations like DP0.2 (based on the [LSST DESC DC2 simulations](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..253...31L/abstract)), the outer scale is finite. In this case, the magnitude of the exponent deviates from $-0.2$ and can even exceed it. This suggests that the magnitude of the exponent should be slightly larger than $-0.2$, not smaller (see Figure 6 of [Zhang T. 2018](https://zenodo.org/records/14947939)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chromatic Sensor Effects:** The dominant reason the fitted exponent is less than $-0.2$ is likely related to be sensor physics effects. Specifically, redder photons penetrate deeper into the silicon in the LSST CCDs, spreading charge over a larger transverse area due to the steep incoming $f/1.2$ beam. Additionally, the simulation treated the beam inside the silicon as $f/1.2$, whereas in reality, it should be closer to $f/4$ or $f/5$ due to refraction at the silicon surface ([Meyers et al. 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015JInst..10C6004M/abstract)). These effects effectively increase the PSF size for redder wavelengths, counteracting the expected $\\lambda^{-0.2}$ scaling and reducing the measured exponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while the finite atmospheric outer scale should have pushed the exponent slightly above $-0.2$, chromatic sensor effects had the opposite sign, resulting in an overall best-fit exponent of approximately $-0.17$."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitionally bound objects in the Universe. According to the General Relatively, massive objects warp the spacetime, and light follows the curvature of spacetime. Thus, massive objects act like lenses that bend the path of the light emitted from distance sources. This effect is called \"gravitional lensing\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The large mass of a galaxy cluster coherently distorts the images of backgroud galaxies, and this distortion occurs over a large sky area around the cluster. The lensing effect on the shape of a single background galaxy far from the cluster center is small, but the lensing signal can be detected by averaging the shape of many background galaxies. This is because the original shapes of the galaxies are randomly oriented. This effect is called weak gravitational lensing (WL), which shows up in the statistics of a large sample of galaxy shapes. More detailed introduction to cluster WL can be found in review papers (e.g., [Bartelmann & Schneider 2001](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001PhR...340..291B/abstract); [Umetsu 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26ARv..28....7U/abstract)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that WL also happens between galaxies and when the light passes through the large-scale structure of the Universe (cosmic shear). Compared to galaxy-galaxy lensing and cosmic shear, the cluster WL signal is generally about 1 magnitude higher (at the level of 10 times). \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook gives an example of detecting lensing signal of clusters using DP0 data."

    "Use the `g` and `r` band color information to remove foreground galaxies, applying relevant flag cuts. Additionally, use the `r` band for shape analysis. Using the `r` band shapes is common in weak lensing studies. The main reason is the balance between seeing and sky brightness for shape measurement ([Fu et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933...84F)). Another reason is that Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR) is weaker in redder bands, which reduces the PSF elongation along the zenith and makes the galaxy's pre-PSF shape easier to measure ([Plazas et al. 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012PASP..124.1113P/abstract)). \n",
